Note that we do not have a single project but multiple small project to discuss the interference. 

The first is the MainWabinab.ipynb file which contains using Bernstein Vazirani algorithm for demonstration and how addition of noises could affect the readout to collapse (i.e. constructively interfere) on a different channel (i.e. different bit string) than the expected channel. 

The second is QKD_Wabinab.ipynb which contains information of implementing Quantum Key Distribution algorithm and how the addition of "virus" (noises) with a large enough rotational phase could affect the actual key even without measuring, and the idea that small phase change could go unnoticed (which could be treated as a virus package), or even with large phase change might change a harmless strings of bits into one harmful to a (classical/quantum) computer **after** measurement (without measuring it takes no effect). However these ideas are very vague and may or may not prove useful or perhaps even directing in the wrong direction, and without proper research nothing could be confirmed.
